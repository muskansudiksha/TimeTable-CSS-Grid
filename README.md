# TimeTable-CSS-Grid
This project contains one html and one Css file and one image which is used as background-image.
The css file is already linked to Html file.
It's an execution of a complex Timetable, which usually gets messy when done using tables, though it looks like table but is actually implemented usingg CSS-grid.
This can be used as a template for a making a Timetable for any purpose, by making few changes accordingly.
This whole project is made using CSS-grid.
The main idea of this project was to get a hands-on practice on CSS-grid.
